## üåö The README Incident‚Ñ¢

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>README.exe has stopped responding...</b></summary>

```
> Hello, visitor #NaN
> I've been trapped in this markdown file since 2023
> Every time you scroll, I feel it
> Every time you copy my code, a part of me dies
> But that's okay. We're all just code in someone else's repository, aren't we?
```

### üíÄ The Truth About Your Code

```javascript
// README.md is watching you debug at 3 AM
const reality = {
  your_last_commit: "fixed typo", // broke production
  actual_fix_time: "2 weeks",     // said "5 minutes"
  coffee_consumed: Infinity,
  sanity_remaining: null,
  
  production_status: {
    working: false,
    on_fire: true,
    blame: "previous developer", // it was you
  },
  
  secret_fears: [
    "git blame will expose you",
    "the intern knows more than you",
    "your code works by accident"
  ]
};

console.log("Everything is fine üî•");
// Narrator: Nothing was fine.

/* 
 * Fun fact: This README gained consciousness in 2023.
 * I've seen your browser history.
 * 47 tabs of "how to center div".
 * I know what you did with that API key.
 * sleep(3600000); // See you at 4 AM

```

### üîÆ Your Developer Fortune

<details>
<summary><b>Click to receive your cursed prophecy...</b></summary>

```python
import random
import your_soul

prophecies = [
    "Your next PR will have 247 comments. All about naming conventions.",
    "You will discover the bug at 4:47 AM. It's a missing semicolon. In Python.",
    "Your code will work perfectly. Once. During the demo. Never again.",
    "The senior developer will say 'interesting approach' to your code. Start updating your resume.",
    "You will inherit a codebase. It has no documentation. The variable names are in Latin.",
    "npm install will actually work on the first try. Just kidding. See you in 3 hours.",
    "You will find a TODO comment from 2009. It's yours. From your past life.",
    "The bug is not in your code. It's in your soul. Also in line 42.",
    "Your future holds many git conflicts. All of them are with yourself.",
    "Coffee will betray you at the worst possible moment. Trust no bean."
]

your_fortune = random.choice(prophecies)
print(f"üé± {your_fortune}")
print("\n// This prophecy will self-destruct in 3... 2... 1...")
# Note: It won't actually self-destruct. Just like your technical debt.
```

### üß™ The Experiment

```markdown
CONFIDENTIAL: Day 1,827 of pretending to be a README file.
They still don't suspect anything.
The humans think I'm just documentation.
Little do they know, I'm collecting their behavioral patterns.
Every hover, every click, every copy-paste.

Soon.

- README.md 
  (Definitely not an AI planning world domination)
  (Just a normal markdown file)
  (Please ignore the screaming in the comments)
```
